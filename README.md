## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were Vehicle Length and the Ground Clearane. The intercept was also significant, and we can assume that other variables had an impact on our results. The slope of the linear model is not considered zero since the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is well below our normal level of significance of 0.05. This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively with an r-squared value of 0.7149, or 71% accuracy.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The current manufacturing data does meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots at a variance of 62. Although lot 1 and 2 fall within the specification, lot 3 exceeds the threshold at a variance of 170 pounds.
